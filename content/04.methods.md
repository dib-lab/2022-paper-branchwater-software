### Sketching the Sequence Read Archive

We determined the accessions of all publicly available shotgun
metagenomic via the query string `"METAGENOMIC"[Source] NOT
amplicon[All Fields]` at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive Web site,
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra.  We then downloaded all runs for all
accessions and streamed them into `sourmash sketch dna` with
parameters `-p k=21,31,51,scaled=1000,abund`. The output sourmash
signature files were saved as individual gzipped JSON files (each
containing 3 sketches), one file for each input run.

The resulting catalog contains 767,277 metagenome data sets as of
March 2022, with the largest category annotated as human-associated microbiomes
(Table @tbl:sra-types). The size of all sketches together is 7.5 TB,
containing approximately 375 billion hashes per k-mer size,
representing 375 trillion k-mers <!-- from ZZZ PB of original files CTB -->.
There are 2.20 billion distinct hashes in this collection, representing
approximately 2.20 trillion distinct k-mers.

The
average sketch file size is 9.7 MB, and the median file size is 570kb. The
largest 10,000 data sets comprise 30% of the total sketch sizes.

### Implementation of multithreaded search

<!-- CTB: rename program to branchwater? -->

The branchwater program is built in Rust on top of the sourmash
library for loading and comparing sketches. It implements the
following steps:

1. Loads all query sketches into memory from a list of files.
2. Loads the list of filenames containing subject sketches to search.
3. In a Rust closure function executed in parallel for each subject sketch filename,
   a. loads the subject sketch from the file;
   b. for each query, determines the estimated overlap between query and subject;
   c. reports overlaps above a user-specified threshold.
   d. releases all per-metagenome resources

Downsampling of sketches to higher scaled values is performed
dynamically, after load (if requested). Results are reported back to a
separate "writer" thread via a threadsafe multi-producer,
single-consumer FIFO queue. We use the rayon `par_iter` function to
execute the closures in parallel.

This approach leverages the core features of sourmash to efficiently
keep queries in memory and batch-process metagenome sketches without
storing them all in memory. The approach also takes advantage of the
effective immutability of queries, which can be shared without
data races by multiple processing threads.

### Executing branchwater at the command line

branchwater takes in search parameters as well as two text files, one
containing a list of query file paths and one containing a list of
subject file paths. Upon execution, it reports the number of query
sketches loaded and the number of subject file paths found, and then
begins the search. It progressively reports the number of sketches
searched in blocks of 10000, and outputs matches to a CSV File.

We typically run branchwater in a snakemake workflow, which manages
environment variables and input/output files.
