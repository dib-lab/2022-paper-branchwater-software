## Abstract {.page_break_before}

We introduce branchwater, a flexible and fast petabase-scale search
for the 767,000 public metagenomes presently in the NCBI Sequence Read
Archive. Our search is based on the FracMinHash k-mer sketching
technique and can search all public metagenomes with 1000 query
genomes in approximately 36 hours using 50 GB of RAM and 32 threads.
Branchwater is a Rust-based multithreading front-end built on top of
the sourmash library. We provide biological use cases, examine
performance, and discuss design and performance considerations.
