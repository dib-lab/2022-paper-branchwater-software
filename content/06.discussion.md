## Discussion {.page_break_before}

*A Discussion (e.g. if the paper includes novel data or analyses) or Conclusions should include a brief discussion of allowances made (if any) for controlling bias or unwanted sources of variability, and the limitations of any novel datasets.*

From luiz thesis:
Making large collections of sequencing data searchable is an open problem, and approaches that work for smaller collections rarely scale well, even for current database sizes. New methods that take advantage of specific particularities of the query and desired answer can help bridge the gap between more general methods by allowing filtering large databases, resulting in more manageable subsets that can be used efficiently with current methods.
Scaled MinHash sketches allow calculating similarity and containment between datasets with- out the need to access the original datasets. Because only a fraction of the original data
need to be stored, (controlled with the scaled parameter) they are good basic components in the implementation of systems that allow searching large collections of datasets.

We provide flexible large-scale fast search, together with some simple downstream summarization tools and a more mature (but slower) investigative ecosystem. This supports and enables a wide range of use cases that explore public data, ranging from biomedical to ecological to technical.

This has been used in two papers so far - Lumian et al, Viehgewer et al. 

We expect more use cases to emerge quickly. Here we believe that itâ€™s important that the low cost of search means that exploratory efforts can be quickly evaluated. The major obstacle at the moment is that it is not realtime nor can it be run by others without direct command-line access to the 13 TB of data. These are topics for future software engineering development.

There are several scientific limitations to overcome as well. The current search approach has limited sensitivity to divergent sequence beyond the genus level, and cannot find smaller matches. These are topics for future research and development.
