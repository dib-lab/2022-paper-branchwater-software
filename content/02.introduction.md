## Introduction {.page_break_before}

*The Introduction should provide context as to why the software tool was developed and what need it addresses. It is good scholarly practice to mention previously developed tools that address similar needs, and why the current tool is needed.*

Substantial growth in publicly available nucleotide sequencing data
(DNA and RNA) has occurred over the last decade, driven by decreases
in sequencing costs.
In particular the Sequence Read Archive now has
over XXX PB of data as of YY date, with YYY PB of data public.
Shotgun metagenomes, generated by random sequencing of mixtures of
microbes sampled from a microbiome are a particularly interesting resource.
Metagenome data sets are often large (100s of MBs to 10s of GB) and
can be highly complex, with environmental samples containing genomic
data that can be attributed to thousands or more species.
In the past decade, hundreds of thousands of new bacterial and archaeal
genomes have been isolated from public metagenomes, and several
entirely new branches of life have been discovered (large bacteriophage,
hug et al, etc.)

Beyond their initial use, these data sets form an incredibly rich
resource for contextualizing novel sequencing data and for synthesis
research on a myriad of large-scale genomic questions ranging from
basic evolutionary processes to disease associations and pathogenicity
(Table X).
However, comprehensive discovery of relevant data sets is challenging.
Metadata for these data sets is typically geared towards the
submitting researcher's major findings and study questions, and cannot
possibly cannot encompass the range of data available within.
Furthermore, metadata provided at the time of submission can be
incomplete or inconsistent, rendering systematic data set discovery
intractable.

Content-based search is a promising alternative strategy.
By searching with genomic content of interest, these approaches can
recover datasets containing relevant species or genes of interest
regardless of their associated metadata.
However, search of unassembled sequence is critical to ensure unbiased
and comprehensive recovery of relevant datasets.
Assembly techniques are designed to obscure sequence variation in
order to produce consensus reference sequences useful for consistent
comparisons across genotypes.
In addition, reassembly and reanalysis of existing data using different
parameters or newer methods often yields different results.
Content-based search of unassembled metagenomes can bypass these issues
and facilitate consistent downstream analysis across data sets that may have
been initially generated to answer a range of disparate
biological questions, and been first analyzed over a range of years and with
myriad techniques.

A number of approaches have been developed to enable content-based search of
single-organism genomic and RNAseq data.
Methods that enable rapid, large-scale search across hundreds of thousands of
data sets typically leverage biological sketching techniques and probabilistic
data structures to reduce the effective search space (SBT, BIGSI, etc).
However, these approaches do not readily translate to datasets with unknown
levels of sequence diversity, the defining feature of metagenomic datasets.

Recent extensive search across viral datasets ... comprehensive but
time-consuming and costly, intractable for independent researchers.


Below, we introduce MAGsearch, an SRA-scale querying system that uses
containment searches based on FracMinHash sketching to search all
public metagenome data sets in the SRA in approximately 24 hours on
commodity hardware with 1-1000 query genomes. MAGsearch uses the Rust
library underlying the sourmash implementation of FracMinHash to
execute massively parallel searches of a presketched digest of the
SRA. This addresses many (but not all) of the use cases in Table XXX.

The availability of relatively lightweight content-based search of SRA
metagenomes presents a possible solution for a number of use cases (Table XX).
Some of these use cases have already been explored with MAGsearch:
Viehweger et al. used MAGsearch to discover a metagenomic sample containing
*Klebsiella pneumonia* that was subsequently included in an outbreak
analysis, and Lumian et al. (2022) conducted a biogeographical study
on five newly generated cyanobacterial genomes from Antarctic samples.


Thoughts and questions:

* do we mention CMash and mash screen? Same challenges as serratus and
  intended for single sample analysis.
  not intended for large scale search but rather s
* (re)emphsaize unassembled, no marker genes
* figure out how to talk about things it can't do - in Table 1, and
  also caption, and also discussion.
* For discussion: content-based search, including MAGs and things
  without marker genes.
* stress lightweight resource usage

Small viral pangenome query comment/Luiz. Association studies?

Anti use cases: small virus search a la serratus. Searching for new
members of class or order. Searching for specific functional genes.
