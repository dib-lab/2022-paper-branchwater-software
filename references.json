Here we sequenced DNA from diverse ecosystems and found hundreds of phage genomes with lengths of more than 200 kilobases (kb), including a genome of 735 kb, which is—to our knowledge—the largest phage genome to be described to date. Thirty-five genomes were manually curated to completion (circular and no gaps). Expanded genetic repertoires include diverse and previously undescribed CRISPR–Cas systems, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), tRNA synthetases, tRNA-modification enzymes, translation-initiation and elongation factors, and ribosomal proteins. The CRISPR–Cas systems of phages have the capacity to silence host transcription factors and translational genes, potentially as part of a larger interaction network that intercepts translation to redirect biosynthesis to phage-encoded functions. In addition, some phages may repurpose bacterial CRISPR–Cas systems to eliminate competing phages. We phylogenetically define the major clades of huge phages from human and other animal microbiomes, as well as from oceans, lakes, sediments, soils and the built environment. We conclude that the large gene inventories of huge phages reflect a conserved biological strategy, and that the phages are distributed across a broad bacterial host range and across Earth’s ecosystems.</jats:p>",

These genomes encode &gt;170 million protein sequences, which we collated in the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalog. The UHGP more than doubles the number of gut proteins in comparison to those present in the Integrated Gene Catalog. More than 70% of the UHGG species lack cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP lack functional annotations. Intraspecies genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which are specific to individual human populations. The UHGG and UHGP collections will enable studies linking genotypes to phenotypes in the human gut microbiome.</jats:p>",

Here we describe two algorithms for compositional analysis of metagenome sequencing data. We first investigate the FracMinHash sketching technique, a derivative of modulo hash that supports Jaccard containment estimation between sets of different sizes. We implement FracMinHash in the sourmash software, evaluate its accuracy, and demonstrate large-scale containment searches of metagenomes using 700,000 microbial reference genomes. We next frame shotgun metagenome compositional analysis as the problem of finding a minimum collection of reference genomes that “cover” the known k-mers in a metagenome, a minimum set cover problem. We implement a greedy approximate solution using FracMinHash sketches, and evaluate its accuracy for taxonomic assignment using a CAMI community benchmark. Finally, we show that the minimum metagenome cover can be used to guide the selection of reference genomes for read mapping. sourmash is available as open source software under the BSD 3-Clause license at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://github.com/dib-lab/sourmash/\">github.com/dib-lab/sourmash/</jats:ext-link>.</jats:p>",

MinHash is one such technique that has enjoyed recent broad application. However, traditional MinHash has previously been shown to perform poorly when applied to sets of very dissimilar sizes. <jats:italic>FracMinHash</jats:italic> was recently introduced as a modification of MinHash to compensate for this lack of performance when set sizes differ. While experimental evidence has been encouraging, FracMinHash has not yet been analyzed from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we perform such an analysis and prove that while FracMinHash is not unbiased, this bias is easily corrected. Next, we detail how a simple mutation model interacts with FracMinHash and are able to derive confidence intervals for evolutionary mutation distances between pairs of sequences as well as hypothesis tests for FracMinHash. We find that FracMinHash estimates the containment of a genome in a large metagenome more accurately and more precisely when compared to traditional MinHash, and the confidence interval performs significantly better in estimating mutation distances.

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing can capture the genomes of all strains present in a community but strain-resolved analysis from shotgun sequencing alone remains difficult. We developed an approach to identify and interrogate strain-level differences in groups of metagenomes. We use this approach to perform a meta-analysis of stool microbiomes from individuals with and without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis; n = 605), a disease for which there are not specific microbial biomarkers but some evidence that microbial strain variation may stratify by disease state. We first developed a machine learning classifier based on compressed representations of complete metagenomes (FracMinHash sketches) and identified genomes that correlate with IBD subtype. To rescue variation that may not have been present in the genomes, we then used assembly graph genome queries to recover strain variation for correlated genomes. Lastly, we developed a novel differential abundance framework that works directly on the assembly graph to uncover all sequence variants correlated with IBD. We refer to this approach as dominating set differential abundance analysis and have implemented it in the <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/spacegraphcats/spacegraphcats\">spacegraphcats software package</jats:ext-link>.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Cyanobacteria form diverse communities and are important primary producers in Antarctic freshwater environments, but their geographic distribution patterns in Antarctica and globally are still unresolved. There are however few genomes of cultured cyanobacteria from Antarctica available and therefore metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from Antarctic cyanobacteria microbial mats provide an opportunity to explore distribution of uncultured taxa. These MAGs also allow comparison with metagenomes of cyanobacteria enriched communities from a range of habitats, geographic locations, and climates. However, most MAGs do not contain 16S rRNA gene sequences, making a 16S rRNA gene-based biogeography comparison difficult. An alternative technique is to use large-scale k-mer searching to find genomes of interest in public metagenomes. This paper presents the results of k-mer based searches for 5 Antarctic cyanobacteria MAGs from Lakes Fryxell and Lake Vanda, assigned the names Phormidium pseudopriestleyi, a Microcoleus, a Leptolyngbya, a Pseudanabaena, and a Neosynechococcus (Lumian et al., 2021, Lumian et al., 2022, in prep.) in 498,942 unassembled metagenomes from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The Microcoleus MAG was found in a wide variety of environments, P. pseudopriestleyi was found in environments with challenging conditions, the Neosynechococcus was only found in Antarctica, and the Leptolyngbya and Pseudanabaena MAGs were found in Antarctic and other cold environments. The findings based on metagenome matches and global comparisons suggest that these Antarctic cyanobacteria have distinct distribution patterns ranging from locally restricted to global distribution across the cold biosphere and other climatic zones.</jats:p>",

The ability of cyanobacteria to counter this effect has implications for understanding the productivity of benthic microbial mats in sulfidic environments throughout Earth history. In Lake Fryxell, Antarctica, the benthic, filamentous cyanobacterium Phormidium pseudopriestleyi creates a 1–2 mm thick layer of 50 µmol L−1 O2 in otherwise sulfidic water, demonstrating that it sustains oxygenic photosynthesis in the presence of sulfide. A metagenome-assembled genome of P. pseudopriestleyi indicates a genetic capacity for oxygenic photosynthesis, including multiple copies of psbA (encoding the D1 protein of Photosystem II), and anoxygenic photosynthesis with a copy of sqr (encoding the sulfide quinone reductase protein that oxidizes sulfide). The genomic content of P. pseudopriestleyi is consistent with sulfide tolerance mechanisms including increasing psbA expression or directly oxidizing sulfide with sulfide quinone reductase. However, the ability of the organism to reduce Photosystem I via sulfide quinone reductase while Photosystem II is sulfide-inhibited, thereby performing anoxygenic photosynthesis in the presence of sulfide, has yet to be demonstrated.</jats:p>",
